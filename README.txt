Portfolio - Assignment 1

Successfully implemented index.html, resume.html, and bio.html, as well as hosted on ksoni02.github.io, and on CS server. Successfully redirected from CS page to github.io hosting site.

Didnâ€™t work on anyone on this assignment, but heavily relied on the www.w3school.com/html page for information on formatting and html syntax. I also used google search to find the image used for my background image from (http://www.coins-bloc.com), and looked into some example portfolios on portfoliobox.com for examples for design (did not use css files, just tried to look at ideas for cleaner layout).

This project took me about 6 hours to do, and most of it entailed bug checking my css and html files.
